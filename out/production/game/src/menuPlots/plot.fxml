The garrison is the total of garrison + raisable.&#10;You can also upgrade your own counties.&#10;You can see the occupier in the left top corner&#10; (not visible if no occupier)&#10;and the owner to the right.&#10;Clicking on either takes you to their character view.&#10;&#10;Character view:&#10;Here you can see the close family, allies and&#10; if the person is a vassal, his or her lord.&#10;You can also see the traits the person has.&#10;Left click any portrait to open their character view.&#10;Left click on currently selected character(biggest circle)&#10; to open a window for additional info(only for lords).&#10;Right click on the currently selected character to&#10; open diplomacy view.(only applies if the target is ruler)&#10;&#10;Diplomacy view:&#10;Here you can marry, declare war and murder ppl.&#10;Murder costs 150 gold(subject to change, might&#10;make it random). Murder has a chance to fail, currently&#10;it's at 70% fail chance.&#10;&#10;Law view:&#10;Here you can choose between 3 different laws.&#10;Hover over the law button for more information.&#10;&#10;*************** PART II - GAME MECHANICS ***********&#10;                                   &#10;Important note:&#10;  All actions take effect after 1 season(forging of alliances,&#10;inheritance and so on) The only exception is battles as &#10;battles happen as soon as 2 opposing armies meet.&#10;&#10;                                   DIPLOMACY&#10;&#10; The world reacts to your conquests and decisions.&#10;  If you are a mass-murdering conqueror the other lords&#10;  will hate you and start to ally against you while ignoring&#10;  your requests for marriage.&#10;  If however there are other threats, greater than you,&#10;  other lords will be more willing to forge maritial ties&#10;  with you, enabling you to make alliances with ease.&#10;&#10;                                   ALLIANCES&#10;&#10; Anyone connected to your close family members are&#10;  automatically made into your allies 1 season after&#10;  the ties are made.&#10;  Additionaly, all vassals are forced to be your allies,&#10;   regardless of familial ties.&#10;&#10;                                      TRAITS&#10; Almost all characters have traits. Traits give bonuses&#10;  or penalties.&#10; Traits also play a role in opinion calculation.&#10; People with opposing traits tend to dislike eachother&#10;  while people who share traits may get a bonus.&#10; This applies to most traits, except for traits that add&#10;  ambition. Ambitious people generally hate others like&#10;  them(in this game anyway).&#10; Some traits also have a timer, for example injuries.&#10; Some traits might also not be visibile, for example&#10;  AI modifiers.&#10;&#10;                                      DEATH&#10;&#10; All characters have a chance to die each season&#10;  based on their age. They can also be murdered for a&#10;  fairly large sum(though murder can often fail).&#10;  &#10; When a character dies, he or she automatically&#10;  divorces his or her spouse, making it possible to&#10;  remarry aswell as cut any alliances connected through&#10;  the union.&#10; &#10; If the one to die is a ruler of a county, the county, all&#10;  the gold and extra troops the ruler had, is inherited.&#10; All armies are lowered when inheritance occurs aswell.&#10;&#10;                                  INHERITANCE&#10;&#10; Inheritance travels down from the dead person's&#10; familial connections according to the laws of the&#10; dead ruler. Parents can also inherit.&#10; There are 3 laws in total:&#10;   Agnatic-Cognatic(the default law everyone starts with),&#10;   Agnatic and Cognatic.&#10; &#10; Agnatic-Cognatic&#10;  Under Agnatic-Cognatic inheritance law the oldest son&#10;  inherits. If there are no sons, the oldest daughter.&#10;  When the ruler is dead, but has grandchildren, the ruler's&#10;  oldest sons sons take preference and so on.&#10; Agnatic&#10;  Under Agnatic inheritance law only sons can inherit&#10;  and daughters are ignored entierly. A game can end&#10;  because you have 10 daughters but no sons and are&#10;  under this law.&#10; Cognatic&#10;  Under Cognatic inheritance law, sons and daughters&#10;  inherit on the same grounds with the oldest child&#10;  taking the inheritance.&#10;&#10; Furthermore, when inheriting, a inheritor that was a lord&#10; before does not inherit the infamy gathered by the dead&#10; lord but someone with no land gets all the infamy of the&#10; last lord.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;                                        WAR&#10;&#10; War is declared in the diplomacy menu.&#10; The goal of any war is to take the county that is part&#10; of the war name. If either county is occupied by the&#10; other side, the war ends. If both the defender's and&#10; attacker's target is occupied by other powers, the war&#10; also automatically ends in a White Peace.&#10; &#10; Effect&#10;  Declaring war costs nothing and causes no infamy.&#10;  When war is declared all your allies are added into the&#10;  attacking party and war ensues.&#10;  It is advised to raise your troops and send them into&#10;  the target county to siege it and claim victory.&#10;   (or send them to a battle they will lose and lose the war..)&#10; NOTE: defenders get allies before attackers, if you share&#10;     an ally, the defending side gets him.&#10; NOTE: you cannot lower armies after raising them when&#10;     at war, this includes new wars so if u get invaded alot&#10;     you will eventually lose(unless you kill attacking armies&#10;     with a massive garrison)&#10;&#10;Units&#10; When an army is raised, it numbers the total of all&#10;  your counties armies.&#10; When two opposing armies meet, the one with&#10;  the biggest army wins, with the remainder of the loser's&#10;  armies dispanding and returning home. The bigger&#10;  army is likely to also take loses.&#10; Armies are never combined, a single huge landowner&#10;  can mow down an alliance of lesser lords, however&#10;  with enough fights even the big army will lose it's&#10;  numbers eventually.&#10;When an army is sent home, 10% of it is lost. Only your&#10;  capital county recives it's troops back, the rest disperse.&#10;  Bear this in mind when you are a powerful lord raising&#10;  an army from several counties, as you can lose large&#10;  amounts of soldiers by sending them home.&#10;  The point of this mechanic is to limit the power of&#10;  already powerful lords.&#10;&#10;Siege&#10; When an army outnumbers the garrison, in a few&#10;  seasons the county will become occupied. The garrison also&#10;  loses units each season it is sieged so even with&#10;  a small army you can still win a siege, it will just take&#10;  time.&#10; Do note that the defending army is the total of both the&#10;  garrison and the unraised army so if you don't outnumber&#10;  the enemies main army and the main army isn't raised&#10;  you Cannot win a war. This might be changed.&#10;&#10;                                   WAR TYPES&#10;&#10; There are 5 types of war in total.&#10;   Note that infamy is only gained on victory.&#10; &#10; Independance - if you are a vassal, you can wage war&#10;  for your independance, gaining independance if you&#10;  win. There are currently no negative effects to losing this.&#10; &#10; Force vassalization - force another lord to become your&#10;  vassal, making him your ally until he or she breaks free.&#10;  It grants moderate infamy and if you lose, you give away&#10;  all your gold.&#10; &#10; Conquest - take control of another lord's county.&#10;  This type of war grants very high infamy, making it&#10;  likely that other lords will attack you.&#10;  Losing this war results in the loss of gold&#10;   aswell as your death.&#10; &#10; Raid - Gain the target's gold and some extra.&#10;  Since you can't see another lord's wealth you can&#10;  never be really sure. Very low infamy.&#10; NOTE: &#10;       1)Unlike other wars, allies don't get called into this.&#10;       2)Unlike other wars, this one ends if Any county&#10; is occupied, not just target.&#10;&#10; &#10; Defensive war - this type is not yet added into the game.&#10;  It's supposed to be a coalition attack against a target&#10;  with high infamy.&#10; &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; " BorderPane.alignment="CENTER" />
